# node-data-transform

Usage

```javascript
var DataTransform = require("node-json-transform").DataTransform,
```

First we need some data.

```javascript
var data = {
	posts : [
		{
			title : "title1",
			description: "description1",
			blog: "This is a blog.",
			date: "11/4/2013",
			extra : {
				link : "http://goo.cm"
			},
			list1:[
				{
					name:"mike"
				}
			],
			list2:[
				{
					item: "thing"
				}
			],
			clearMe: "text"
		}
	]
};
```

The map defines how the output will be structured and which operations to run.

```javascript
var map = {
	list : 'posts',
	item: {
		name: "title",
		info: "description",
		text: "blog",
		date: "date",
		link: "extra.link",
		item: "list1.0.name",
		clearMe: "",
		fieldGroup: ['title', 'extra']
	},
	operate: [
		{
			run: "Date.parse", on: "date",
			run: function(val) { return val + " more info"}, on: "info"
		}
	]
};
```
You can read this as follows:
- Get the array of objects in "posts".
- Map the name to title, info to description etc.
- Run Data.parse on the date value

Run it
```javascript
var dataTransform = DataTransform(data, map);
var result = dataTransform.transform();
console.log(result);
```

The expected output.
```javascript
[{
	name : "title1",
	info: "description1",
	text: "This is a blog.",
	date: 1383544800000,
	link: "http://goo.cm",
	info: "mike more info",
	clearMe: "",
	fieldGroup: ['title1', { link : "http://goo.cm" }]
}]
```

Enjoy!
